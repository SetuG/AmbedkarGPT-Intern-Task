He highlights the emphasis on avoiding evil, doing good, and purifying the mind as key aspects of this philosophy.\n\nAlthough there is no direct comparison between the two documents regarding education, it can be inferred that both documents share a common theme of the transformative power of knowledge and personal development for marginalized groups (the untouchables and those following Buddha's Dhamma).

He suggests that the solution to the problem of untouchability lies in the annihilation of caste, and emphasizes the importance of political power for the emancipation of the untouchables. Furthermore, he advocates for education, self-organization, and entry into government services as means for the upliftment of the untouchables (Document 3). Lastly, Ambedkar's ideal society seems to be influenced by Buddhism, as he views Buddha's Dhamma as the only religion that can create a society of free and equal men, and emphasizes the law of Karma and self-determination (Document 3).",

The protection against this enemy is provided by the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, which include the right to equality, freedom, and constitutional remedies.\n\nIn Document 6, the \"enemy\" is the belief in the sanctity and infallibility of the shastras (scriptures). The author argues that as long as people believe in their authority, they will not be able to overcome issues like caste, which is compared to a deeply rooted tree. The real work of social reform, according to the author, is to attack these roots by challenging the belief in the shastras, rather than just pruning its effects (like social reformers who focus on symptoms without addressing the cause).\n\nSo, while the specific enemies are different in Documents 1 and 6, both emphasize the importance of addressing the root causes rather than just the symptoms to bring about meaningful change.",
